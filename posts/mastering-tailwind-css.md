Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. Let's dive into what makes it special.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind provides several advantages:

- No more naming things
- Consistent design system
- Highly customizable
- Small production bundles
- Great developer experience

## Basic Concepts

Tailwind works by scanning your HTML files for class names and generating the corresponding CSS. Here's a simple example:

```html
<div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Hello, Tailwind!</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600">This is a simple card component.</p>
</div>
```
